I was having trouble in the background img 
Whenever I shortened the viewport, the tower would
start moving up and fucked everything up.

I solved by manually going and cropping the full image
Don't know how but this fixed and while shortening the
viewport the image and the tower no longer went up 
and remained where it was.

I have attached the original image and the cropped image.
Only the cropped img is used in the code.
